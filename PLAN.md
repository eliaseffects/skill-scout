# Skill Scout — Development Plan

> A one-page website that helps people discover OpenClaw “skills” they didn’t know existed, with fast search + filters and a copy-paste install command.

---

## A. Vision

### What It Is
Skill Scout is a lightweight discovery page: type what you want to do (“tweet”, “calendar”, “pdf”, “ssh”, “reminders”), and it returns matching skills with a short description, source link, and the exact command to add/install it.

This is explicitly for “unknown unknowns”: people don’t know what skills exist, so they can’t ask for them.

### Why It Matters
- Skill ecosystems die when discovery is hard.
- Users don’t want to browse GitHub repos; they want “tell me what exists for my goal”.
- A single good discovery page becomes the default shareable link in docs/Discord.

### Design Principles
- **One page, instant results** (no login, no onboarding).
- **Speed > novelty** (search must feel instantaneous).
- **Copy/paste friendly** (commands and links are the product).
- **Trust via provenance** (show source repo + last updated).
- **Index-first architecture** (precompute index; don’t rely on a slow live crawl).

## B. Target User Experience

### Basic Usage
1. User lands on `/`.
2. Sees a single search input: “What are you trying to do?”
3. Types query, e.g. `twitter post`, `reminders`, `pdf edit`, `rss`.
4. Results update live with:
   - Skill name
   - 1-line description
   - Tags/capabilities (if available)
   - Source (GitHub/org)
   - Install command (copy button)

### Advanced Usage
- Filter by:
  - Provider/org (e.g. vercel-labs)
  - Category (messaging, docs, automation, media, devtools)
  - “Official” vs “Community” (heuristic)
  - OS support / requirements (if metadata exists)
- “Show me alternatives” (skills with similar tags)
- Deep linkable search:
  - `/q/twitter`
  - `/?q=calendar&org=vercel-labs`

---

## C. Technology Stack

### Web Framework
- **Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript**
  - Easy deployment to Vercel
  - Static export / ISR options
  - Simple route structure

### UI
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui optional (only if you want polished components fast)

### Search
- **Client-side fuzzy search** via MiniSearch or Fuse.js
  - Prebuilt JSON index shipped with the site
  - Optional: build-time generation of a MiniSearch index

### Data/Index
- A single `skills-index.json` (and optionally `skills-index.minisearch.json`) generated by a script.
- Source of truth:
  - The output/metadata from `find-skills` (from vercel-labs/skills), OR
  - A curated list of registries/repos to crawl.

### Hosting
- Vercel
- Static assets via Vercel CDN

## D. Project Structure

```text
skill-scout/
  app/
    page.tsx                 # one-page UI
    api/
      index/route.ts         # optional: serve index JSON (or use /public)
  components/
    SearchBar.tsx
    Filters.tsx
    SkillCard.tsx
    CopyButton.tsx
  lib/
    search.ts                # wraps Fuse/MiniSearch
    skillIndex.ts            # types + helpers
  public/
    index/
      skills-index.json      # generated
  scripts/
    build-index.ts           # fetch/crawl/generate index
  data/
    sources.json             # list of registries/repos to include
  PLAN.md
  README.md
```

Notes:
- Keep the UI dead simple. The “magic” is the index quality.
- The index build should be deterministic and easy to run locally + in CI.

## E. Command & API Design

### Core Data Model (Index Item)
Each skill entry should normalize to:
- `id` (stable string, e.g. `org/repo/skillName`)
- `name`
- `description`
- `homepage` (skills.sh link)
- `repoUrl`
- `tags[]` (optional)
- `category` (optional)
- `installCommand`
  - Example shape: `npx skills add <repoUrl> --skill <skillName>`
- `updatedAt` (if available)
- `source` (where we discovered it: registry URL, repo, etc.)

### Optional API
- `GET /api/index` returns the JSON index.
  - Useful if you want to keep index out of the initial bundle.

## F. Feature Breakdown

### Phase 1: MVP (1-2 days)
- One-page UI with:
  - Search input
  - Results list
  - “Copy install command” button
  - Links to source + skills.sh page
- Index generation script:
  - Pull skills from the chosen source(s)
  - Normalize fields
  - Output `public/index/skills-index.json`
- Basic filters (optional for MVP): org/source only
- Mobile-friendly layout

### Phase 2: Polish (2-4 days)
- Better relevance ranking:
  - Exact match boosts
  - Tag boosts
  - Description match weighting
- UX upgrades:
  - Keyboard navigation (↑/↓/Enter)
  - “No results” suggestions (“try: pdf, calendar, twitter…”) based on popular tags
  - URL-synced search query
- Filter chips + clear-all
- “Similar skills” panel per result

### Phase 3: Advanced (1-2 weeks)
- Community submission flow:
  - “Suggest a skill” -> GitHub PR to `data/sources.json` or `data/curated.json`
- Quality scoring:
  - Stars, last commit, README presence
  - Warnings (archived repo, stale)
- Versioned indices + changelog
- Optional: server-side search endpoint for huge catalogs

---

## G. Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Index normalization:
  - Required fields present
  - Deterministic IDs
  - Install command formatting
- Search ranking logic (if custom ranking added)

### Integration Tests
- “Build index” produces valid JSON schema
- App can load index and render results

### Manual Testing (QA Checklist)
- Mobile viewport: search + scroll results
- Copy button works in major browsers
- Query preserved in URL
- Empty state and loading state look good

---

## H. Build & Release

### Build Configuration
- `pnpm` (or npm) + Next.js build
- Index generation runs before build

### CI/CD Pipeline
- GitHub Actions:
  - On PR: lint, tests, build
  - On main: build + deploy (Vercel integration)
- Scheduled workflow (optional): regenerate index daily

### Versioning
- Semver for the project
- Index version stamp included in UI footer (build timestamp)

## M. Success Metrics

- Time-to-first-successful-discovery: user finds a skill within 15 seconds
- Search-to-copy rate (copy button clicks / searches)
- Return users (people come back when they need a new capability)
- Catalog coverage growth (number of indexed skills)
